# Quantum Convolutional Neural Network

COMP551 - Computer Vision with Deep Learning

Term Project - Fall 2020 

Notebooks can be directly run in Google Colab. To run QCNN.ipynb notebook, python files should be placed in the working directory. 

- **QCNN.ipynb**: Uses defined functions in python files. Includes visualization of filters and circuits. Can define number of training and testing samples, training batch size, epoch numbers. 
- **QCNN_detailed_Train300.ipynb** & **QCNN_detailed_TrainAll.ipynb**: all functions are defined within the notebook. 
- **CNN_classic.ipynb**: Classic CNN model for comparison. 

trials folder:
- **patch_trial.ipynb**: Trial for taking larger images (16x16) as input. Dataset is prepared as circuits of patches. 
- **MultiQubit_MultiLayer.ipynb**: Trials for multi-qubit gates and multiple PQC layers. 
- **Hybrid.ipynb**: Trial for hybrid model CNN+QCNN.
